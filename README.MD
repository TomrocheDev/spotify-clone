I am currently working on a serverless Spotify clone project to test my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It aims to replicate key features of Spotify's interface and functionality. The project is still in progress, and I am focusing on creating a user-friendly interface, implementing responsive design, and incorporating dynamic content loading using JavaScript.
